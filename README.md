# go-lox

lox interpreter in go

## Why?

This project was created as part of Codecrafters' "Build Your Own Interpreter" challenge. Following the book [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/introduction.html), I wanted to explore Go by building a simple (incomplete) Lox interpreter.
